# Routes

TanStack Start uses **file-based routing**. Every `.tsx` file in this directory
defines a route. Do **not** create `src/pages/`, `src/routes/_app/index.tsx`, or
`app/layout.tsx` — those are Next.js / Remix conventions. The only root layout
is `src/routes/__root.tsx`.

The legacy `apps/web` Next.js app is not part of the active root build. Do not
add new product routes, API handlers, security headers, or data loaders there
unless you are intentionally working on the archived Next app.

## Conventions

| File | URL |
| --- | --- |
| `index.tsx` | `/` |
| `about.tsx` | `/about` |
| `users/index.tsx` | `/users` |
| `users/$id.tsx` | `/users/:id` (dynamic — bare `$`, no curly braces) |
| `posts/{-$category}.tsx` | `/posts/:category?` (optional segment) |
| `files/$.tsx` | `/files/*` (splat — read via `_splat` param, never `*`) |
| `_layout.tsx` | layout route (renders children via `<Outlet />`) |
| `__root.tsx` | app shell — wraps every page; preserve `<Outlet />` |

`routeTree.gen.ts` is auto-generated. Don't edit it by hand.
